Use IBMâ€™s Data Science Experience (DSX) and Bluemix cloud services to create a working cloud-based application from start to finish.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that build upon one another so it is important that they are completed in order.

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with loading raw delimited data into DB2 Warehouse for Cloud and interacting with that data from a Jupyter notebook in DSX with python.

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) on the loaded data to create categorical predictions using pyspark and a supervised learning model and store the results back to the database.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The final lab will guide participants in creating an R notebook and Shiny UI in DSX using RStudio.

## Instructions:

### Step 1. Sign up for the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).   We recommend using the Firefox browser.

__NOTE__: If you already have a DSX account, please skip to __Step 2__.

#### Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

2.  Click the signup button on the top right

8. It will take a minute to create your account. When ready, click on Get Started.

 > You are now in the Data Science Experience landing page. Your environment is automatically set up with one Apache Spark instance and 5 GB of object storage. From here you can explore any of the tutorials, videos, sample notebooks, totorials or articles in the community.

### Step 2. Create a project

1. Click on Projects > View All Projects to see a list of your projects. You should only see a default project.

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.

 > You are now in your new project where you can create notebooks and data assets as well as add collaborators.
